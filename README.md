<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was made for class for the CodingDojo WebFundamentals presentation, on December 22, 2023. I built an outlining tool that was suited for my personal needs. This repository is made not just for holding the results of my project, but also acts as a space to aid my presentation. Fundamentally, I want to demonstrate the tool's capabilities through my specific and idiosyncratic use of it, but my secondary goal is to show how the concept is extensible to outlining and planning needs writ-large. I believe my tool does more than fill a niche in the 'outlining app' space; my highest hopes are that it will become the outlining tool of choice for the smart writer.

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

- https://sass-lang.com

<!-- How to Use -->
## How to Use

Unlike a program or app that you download, this tool is only hosted on the web. It is lightweight and meant to be used loosey-goosey. This tool does not aim to be a one-stop-shop, nor a swiss army knife. This tool is best likened to a kitchen knife, and its intent is to be your favorite knife in the drawer. 

### Current Usage Workarounds Due to Lack of Data Persistency

This project is made entirely with basic front-end concepts right now. As such, there is no sophisticated way of saving your data. Two methods for saving exist as workarounds. 

1. Because it is made with basic html, CSS, and Javascript, the user can simply save the page as an html file, and the functionality will be entirely retained as long as all the images are re-sourced.
2. A print button is added to give the user the option to "print to PDF." This will no longer be editable, but the exact look of what you made will be retained.

### Start and Go

There is no setup involved. The tool is meant to be used the second you open the page. In the future, added capabilities will hopefully not undercut this, but if data persistency is achieved through the use of JSON this may (but hopefully won't) change.

## Usage

Will fill out later. 


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] The line tool is fully developed
- [x] Draw mode has its proof of concept
- [ ] Create data persistency
- [ ] Create a 'multi-page' form that the user can cycle through with a carousel. 
- [ ] Expand the canvas tool so it has the brunt of features on Excalidraw
- [ ] Create a way for users to create their own classes. 


See the [open issues](https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
